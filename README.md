### ResearchTrack-I-Holonomic robot

**Farzin Sarvari(S5057724)**

### Robot behaviour
The ROS nodes here allow for controlling a holonomic robot by computing the velocity needed to drive it towards a target position, by defined as a couple of random vectors between (-6.0, 6.0).

---
### How to running
we are going to run ROS package nonholonomic_controlling by using 'assignment1-main' and 'parameters-main'(required by the CMake file). If all these three packages are present on the machine it's sufficient to run:
```bash
# catkin_make
```
